3D Graphics world drawn using OpenGL in Java (JOGL). Features:
Unique 3D Avatar (Animated! Swings teapot hand while walking around.)
Controls to allow the avatar to move through the world
Camera that follow the avatar around (1st person, 3rd person)
World generated in 3d from a textfile describing the world
"Realistic" light source from a pretty quickly orbiting sun so you can appreciate shadow movement (see images)
Teapot trees with brick textures
Portals that will teleport the character and camera between them
A VBO object (drawn using shaders rather than default 3d shapes with textures in OpenGL)
Roads which are described in the world building text file (they can go up hills too!)
